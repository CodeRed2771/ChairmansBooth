#
# So, How do I configure Stuff? Well.....
#
# questionOrder can either be RANDOM, SHUFFLED, or SEQUENTIAL.
#
# displayColors determines whether colors are displayed when a
# question is right or wrong.  Can be true/false.
#
# useHorn determines whether the horn is used. Can be true/false.
#
# hornDuration sets how long the horn is played, and can be any 
# positive integer, only applicable if useHorn has been set to true.  
# 
# useTimer determines whether or not the player plays agains a clock.
# This can be true/false.
#
# timerDuration sets how long the timer is set for, if the useTimer
# variable is set to true.  Can be any positive integer.
#
# numberOfQuestions sets how many questions are in one quiz. IT
# can be any positive integer.
#
# CSVSplitBy can equal any character, or any string of characters.
# This determines what to split the question CSV file by.  Please
# only modify this if you are absolutely sure you know what you 
# are doing.  (The recommended character is ">").
